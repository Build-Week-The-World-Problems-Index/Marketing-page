            City pollution and smog is a big deal. 10,000,000 tons of smog are released into the atmosphere each day. World Problems Index is proud to have donated thousands of bicycles across the world with our free rental system. Just download our app, go to a designated bicycle location in your city, and ride away. Return the bicycle within 24 hours and the ride is free!

          <p>
            World Problems Index has worked with city planners in Singapore to introduce "green" apartments. Experts are designing apartments and high rise buildings with the ability to house nature alongside modern architecture in stunning fashion.

          <h2>Ohio, USA</h2>
          <p>
            When a certain factory was breaking codes and not following laws in Cincinnatti, Ohio, a concerned citizen came to World Problems Index for help. We raised issue with the EPA and recieved enough petition signatures for a full investigation. The EPA found that the factory was in fact in violation of codes, and was forced to reduce their emissions.

          <p>
            A concerned citizen brought to our attention that street lights were being turned off at night in Atlanta, Georgia. During that time, accidents during night hours increased 250%. World Problems Index was in contact with the mayor of the city in less than 24 hours and the problem was immediately resolved.

            Climate change is something that is always on our radar. Thanks to donations from members of the Index, we have been able to fund cutting-edge climate research in Antarctica, as well as Northern Canada and Alaska.

          <h2>Montana, USA</h2>
          <p>
            When it was brought to our attention that the wolf population was declining rapidly in Bozeman, Montana, we sent a wildlife investigator to discover the root cause of the issue. For months, we followed the trail until we discovered that a local gun club had been encouraging its members to shoot the wolves, which are protected. We contacted a local wildlife ranger and the gun club was fined and forced to shut down.
